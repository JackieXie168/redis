Upgrade urgency levels:

LOW:      No need to upgrade unless there are new features you want to use.
MODERATE: Program an upgrade of the server, but it's not urgent.
HIGH:     There is a critical bug that may affect a subset of users. Upgrade!
CRITICAL: There is a critical bug affecting MOST USERS. Upgrade ASAP.

--[ Redis 2.8 Release Candidate 1 (2.7.101) ] Release date: 18 Jul 2013

This is the first release candidate of Redis 2.8 (official version is 2.7.101).

The following is a list of improvements in Redis 2.8, compared to Redis 2.6.

* [NEW] Slaves are now able to partially resynchronize with the master, so most
        of the times a full resynchronization with the RDB creation in the master
        side is not needed when the master-slave link is disconnected for a short
        amount of time.
* [NEW] Experimental IPv6 support.
* [NEW] Slaves explicitly ping masters now, a master is able to detect a timed out
        slave independently.
* [NEW] Masters can stop accepting writes if not enough slaves with a given
        maximum latency are connected.
* [NEW] Keyspace changes notifications via Pub/Sub.
* [NEW] CONFIG SET maxclients is now available.
* [NEW] Ability to bind multiple IP addresses.
* [NEW] Set process names so that you can recognize, in the "ps" command output,
        the listening port of an instance, or if it is a saving child.
* [NEW] Automatic memory check on crash.
* [NEW] CONFIG REWRITE is able to materialize the changes in the configuration
        operated using CONFIG SET into the redis.conf file.
* [NEW] More NetBSD friendly code base.
* [NEW] PUBSUB command for Pub/Sub introspection capabilities.
* [NEW] EVALSHA can now be replicated as such, without requiring to be expanded
        to a full EVAL for the replication link.
* [NEW] Better Lua scripts error reporting.
* [NEW] SDIFF performance improved.
* [FIX] A number of bugfixes.

Migrating from 2.6 to 2.8
=========================

Redis 2.6 is mostly a strict subset of 2.8. However there are a few things
that you should be aware of:

The following commands changed behavior:

    * SORT with ALPHA now sorts according to local collation locale if no STORE
      option is used.
    * ZADD/ZINCRBY are now able to accept a bigger range of values as valid
      scores, that is, all the values you may end having as a result of
      calling ZINCRBY multiple times.
    * Many errors are now prefixed by a more specific error code instead of
      the generic -ERR, for example -WRONGTYPE, -NOAUTH, ...
    * PUBLISH called inside Lua scripts is now correctly propagated to slaves.

The following redis.conf and CONFIG GET / SET parameters changed:

    * logfile now uses the empty string in order to log to standard output,
      so 'logfile stdout' is now invalid, use 'logfile ""' instead.

The following INFO fields changed format in a non-backward compatible way:

    * The list of slaves in INFO is now in field=value format.

Replication:

    Redis 2.8 can be used as slave for Redis 2.6, but doing this is only
    a good idea for the short amount of time needed to upgrade your servers.
    We suggest to update both master and slaves at about the same time.
