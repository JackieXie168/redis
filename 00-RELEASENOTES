This is the testing branch. It will become Redis 3.2 after more fixes
and possibly more features will be added.

All the potentially very unstable work will go into the "unstable" branch.
Fixes and safe features will be back ported here into "testing" for some
time, then RC1 will be released and we'll freeze the code base.
